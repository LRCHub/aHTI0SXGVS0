# XG – IS THIS LOVE

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Yeah
You're my sunshine
You're the only one
I wanna give all my time
There's just something about it
Soon as we met
I couldn't even help it
Yeah I got a feeling
And I can't ignore it
I ain't playin' no games
I mean what I say
Got you on my mind
If you feel the same
Won't you swing my way
Baby don't make me wait
I don't know if it's meant to be
But it feels like everything
Is this love is this love?
Is this love is this love?
Taking over me feel that energy
Is this love is this love?
I don't know why
They say love is so blind
Something so hard to find
But I think we found it
I think we got it
No doubt about it
If it ain't then what's love
(What's love)
Someone tell me what's up
(What's up)
What's love gonna do
When you feeling blue
You been lookin' for the truth
So I'm telling you
But all this time in the back of my mind
It's back to remind me
So let me learn what I never knew
Now you got me like woo
I don't care
I want you to take me there
Baby let's get away
Will I know what it means one day?
Is this love is this love?
Is this love is this love?
Taking over me feel that energy
Is this love is this love?
Some things I just can't seem to figure out
This feeling of love jumping up and down
Still don't get it
Just being honest
Guess I'm stuck here with the same question baby
Is this love is this love?
Is this love is this love?
Taking over me feel that energy
Is this love is this love?
