I want you to love me, like I'm a hot pie
Keep thinkin' of me, doin' what you like
So boy forget about the world cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it, then I'm a make you swallow your pride

Ooh

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Want you to
Want you to

Want you to take it, like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets
That I'm keepin', you can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', be my prisoner for the night

Ooh

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only girl that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only girl who knows your heart

Oh Ow Oooh

Want you to
Want you to
Want you to
Want you to

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Take me for a ride, ride
And make it last all night

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Take me for a ride, ride
And make me dance all night

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Want you to
Want you to
Want you to
Want you to

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Oh Ow Oooh

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
